Sour is a script that automates uploading of screenshots.

You can use sour to:
    - Take a screenshot -> upload -> paste somewhere
    - Take a screenshot -> make thumbnail -> upload -> paste somewhere
    - Automate posting to forums, BBCode automagically added
    - Use an existing image (either from a URL, or a filepath)
    - Review logs of all past uploads (and the URLs needed to delete any image)

sour makes uploading of screenshots seamless and painless.

Use 'sour --help' to see all options, and feel free to register for your own
Imgur API key.
