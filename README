sour

sour is a script that automates uploading of screenshots.
sour makes uploading of screenshots seamless and painless.

You can use sour to:
    - Take a screenshot -> upload -> paste somewhere
    - Take a screenshot -> make thumbnail -> upload -> paste somewhere
    - Automate posting to forums, BBCode automagically added
    - Use an existing image (either from a URL, or a filepath)
    - Review logs of all past uploads (and the URLs needed to delete any image)
    - Automate screenshot-replies in IRC (use -p)

sour: upload to imgur faster

usage:
    -h, --help              help
    -v, --verbose           verbose output
    -s, --select            select area (does scrot -s)
    -f, --forum             BBCode format for forums (uses [url=...] and a thumbnail)
    -t, --thumb             also make thumbnail (included as part of -f)
    -n, --nodel             don't delete images when done
    -u, --url {URL}         don't scrot; download {URL} instead
    -e, --existing {PATH}   don't scrot; use image in {PATH}
    -d, --debug             more output (includes -v)
    -o, --out               send URL/s to stdout instead of xclip
    -p, --prefix "MSG: "    result is "MSG: URL" (not compatible with -t or -f)

- options must be used separately (i.e.: "-s -f", not "-sf")
