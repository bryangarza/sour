sour

sour is a script that automates uploading of screenshots,
    making uploading of screenshots seamless and painless.

setup:
    - clone this repo into ~/.sour:
        `git clone git://github.com/wolfcore/sour.git ~/.sour`
    - sour attempts to recreate missing files -- so if you accidentally delete
      ~/.sour/key, don't worry, just run sour once and it'll fix itself

sour: usage:

    -h | --help              help
    -s | --select            select area (does scrot -s)
    -f | --forum             also make thumbnail, output with BBCode 
    -k | --keep              keep images when done, don't remove
    -u | --url {URL}         don't scrot; download {URL} instead
    -e | --existing {PATH}   don't scrot; use image in {PATH}
    -p | --prefix "MSG: "    result is "MSG: URL" (not compatible with -t or -f)

    - options must be used separately (i.e.: "-s -f", not "-sf")
    - when using an existing image, it won't be removed regardless of your
        usage of --keep (thumbnails do get removed unless you use -k or --keep)

log:
    - you can find all past URLs and their deletion URLs in the log directory.

key:
    -you can register for your own key at http://imgur.com/register/api_anon
        (don't forget to edit .sour/key!)

depends:
    - curl
    - scrot
    - imagemagick
